# Development Notes

## Console Errors Fixed

### Issues Resolved:
1. **React DevTools Warning**: This is just a development suggestion, not a critical error
2. **Minified React Error #130**: Fixed by using dynamic imports for client-side only components
3. **PWA Precaching Errors**: Disabled PWA in development mode to prevent service worker conflicts

### Changes Made:
1. **next.config.ts**: 
   - Disabled PWA in development mode
   - Added React strict mode
   - Improved headers configuration

2. **src/app/scan/page.tsx**:
   - Converted to use dynamic imports to prevent SSR hydration issues
   - Added loading state for better UX

### Current Status:
✅ Development server runs without console errors
✅ PWA functionality preserved for production builds
✅ Camera functionality preserved
✅ All TypeScript compilation passes

### Running the Application:

**Development Mode (HTTP):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Development Mode with HTTPS (for camera testing):**
```bash
npm run dev:https
```

**Production Build:**
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Notes:
- Console errors are now resolved
- PWA features will work properly in production
- Camera access works on localhost (HTTP) and HTTPS
- Dynamic imports prevent hydration mismatches
